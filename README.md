# Python_SSH_Scripts

This Script allows you to define an IP Address and it will then ask the user to login with his username and password.
Hope this is helpful for anyone.
The SSH Script will default connect on Port 22 (the standard SSH Port).


Some work in Progress Python Scripts to SSH into a machine.

Have fun,
