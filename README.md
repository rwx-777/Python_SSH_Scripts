# Python_SSH_Scripts

This Script allows you to define an IP Address and it will then ask the user to login with his username and password.
Hope this is helpful for anyone.
The SSH Script will default connect on Port 22 (the standard SSH Port).

Furthermore you can now upload and download files from the machine using Sftp which does not run over ftp(21) but over ssh on Port 22.
Very smooth.


Some work in Progress Python Scripts to SSH into a machine.

Have fun,
